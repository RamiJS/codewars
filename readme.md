# Codewars Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various coding challenges from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). Codewars is a platform where developers can improve their coding skills by solving increasingly difficult challenges using different programming languages.

## How to Use

Each solution is organized in a separate folder named after the corresponding challenge. Within each folder, you'll find a solution file (typically with a `.js`), along with any necessary input or test files.

To run the solutions, you'll need to have the appropriate programming language installed on your machine. Simply navigate to the relevant folder and run the solution file using your preferred IDE or command line tool.

Please note that these solutions are not intended to be the only or even the best way to solve the challenges. They simply represent my own approach to each problem and are provided for educational purposes.
